-Enemy
-More guns should be added
-Code is bad written and can also be optimized

## About
This is a game I made between 2020-2021, when I was in 8th grade.

This was the way for me to learn Unity and C#, using the internet while building the project.

The code is super messy and unoptimized, yet if I could write it again it would look much better.
